Here's the header of the initialization method of the class any field defined
in OpenERP inherits (as you can see in server/bin/osv/fields.py)::

    def __init__(self, string='unknown', required=False, readonly=False,
                 domain=None, context="", states=None, priority=0, change_default=False, size=None,
                 ondelete="set null", translate=False, select=False, **args) :

There are a common set of optional parameters that are available to most field
types:

:change_default: 
	Whether or not the user can define default values on other fields depending 
	on the value of this field. Those default values need to be defined in
	the ir.values table.
:help: 
	A description of how the field should be used: longer and more descriptive
	than `string`. It will appear in a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the 
	field.
:ondelete: 
	How to handle deletions in a related record. Allowable values are: 
	'restrict', 'no action', 'cascade', 'set null', and 'set default'.
:priority: Not used?
:readonly: `True` if the user cannot edit this field, otherwise `False`.
:required:
	`True` if this field must have a value before the object can be saved, 
	otherwise `False`.
:size: The size of the field in the database: number characters or digits.
:states:
	Lets you override other parameters for specific states of this object. 
	Accepts a dictionary with the state names as keys and a list of name/value 
	tuples as the values. For example: `states={'posted':[('readonly',True)]}`
:string: 
	The field name as it should appear in a label or column header. Strings
	containing non-ASCII characters must use python unicode objects. 
	For example: `'tested': fields.boolean(u'Test√©')` 
:translate:
	`True` if the *content* of this field should be translated, otherwise 
	`False`.

There are also some optional parameters that are specific to some field types:

:context: 
	Define a variable's value visible in the view's context or an on-change 
	function. Used when searching child table of `one2many` relationship?
:domain: 
    Domain restriction on a relational field.

    Default value: []. 

    Example: domain=[('field','=',value)])
:invisible: Hide the field's value in forms. For example, a password.
:on_change:
	Default value for the `on_change` attribute in the view. This will launch
	a function on the server when the field changes in the client. For example,
	`on_change="onchange_shop_id(shop_id)"`. 
:relation:
	Used when a field is an id reference to another table. This is the name of
	the table to look in. Most commonly used with related and function field
	types.
:select: 
	Default value for the `select` attribute in the view. 1 means basic search,
	and 2 means advanced search.
