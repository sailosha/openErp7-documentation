# Why not use openERP7 
As a dev, I enjoy learning new things in the MODERN time, but most people in the real world won't upgrade their system at all. The documentation is missing some essential images. It does not even ask you to do a favor to add new features in this old fashion boomer age stuff. Just fix the image the dir so I could understand what your broken documentation is trying to say. And here is a good reason you don't want to work with old stuff.
