`_auto`
  Determines whether a corresponding PostgreSQL table must be generated
  automatically from the object. Setting _auto to False can be useful in case
  of OpenERP objects generated from PostgreSQL views. See the "Reporting From
  PostgreSQL Views" section for more details.

`_columns (required)`
  The object fields. See the :ref:`fields <fields-link>` section for further details.

`_constraints`
  The constraints on the object. See the constraints section for details.

`_sql_constraints`
  The SQL Constraint on the object. See the SQL constraints section for further details.

`_defaults`
  The default values for some of the object's fields. See the default value section for details.

`_inherit`
  The name of the osv object which the current object inherits from. See the :ref:`object inheritance section<inherit-link>`
  (first form) for further details.

`_inherits`
  The list of osv objects the object inherits from. This list must be given in
  a python dictionary of the form: {'name_of_the_parent_object':
  'name_of_the_field', ...}. See the :ref:`object inheritance section<inherits-link>` 
  (second form) for further details. Default value: {}.

`_log_access`
  Determines whether or not the write access to the resource must be logged.
  If true, four fields will be created in the SQL table: create_uid,
  create_date, write_uid, write_date. Those fields represent respectively the
  id of the user who created the record, the creation date of record, the id
  of the user who last modified the record, and the date of that last
  modification. This data may be obtained by using the perm_read method.

`_name (required)`
  Name of the object. Default value: None.

`_order`
  Name of the fields used to sort the results of the search and read methods.

  Default value: 'id'.

  Examples::

    _order = "name"  
    _order = "date_order desc"

`_rec_name`
  Name of the field in which the name of every resource is stored. Default
  value: 'name'. Note: by default, the name_get method simply returns the
  content of this field.

`_sequence`
  Name of the SQL sequence that manages the ids for this object. Default value: None.

`_sql`
 SQL code executed upon creation of the object (only if _auto is True). It means this code gets executed after the table is created.

`_table`
  Name of the SQL table. Default value: the value of the _name field above
  with the dots ( . ) replaced by underscores ( _ ).
